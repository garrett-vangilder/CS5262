        "Extreme weather events are becoming more likely as the effects of climate change are realized. This can be seen in the plethora of wildfires throughout the West. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) does not declare every extreme weather event a disaster, but through a workflow specified by the Stafford Act, state and federal leaders can work together to determine if federal aid is necessary. The type of aid given to individuals is broad. It can include financial gifts to individuals or small businesses with the intention of using the funds for temporary housing or repairs.\n",

        "Is it possible to use [historical FEMA declarations](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/headsortails/us-natural-disaster-declarations) to determine the change in frequency of catastrophic weather events for a given state? Are catastrophic weather events becoming more prevalent?"

        "\n",
        "Using historical FEMA disaster records, researchers can determine the likelihood of future disasters and disaster types when given a date and a state location. This could be useful in analyzing changes to local and federal funding for extreme weather events. This research can potentially be used as a proxy for defining the financial repercussions of climate change. When paired with a municipalities budget and other financial records, this data could help decide if funds are over or under-provisioned for disaster relief. Federal governments could extrapolate this data to inform federal funding better. There may even be a case for private real estate development firms to use this model when selecting the viability of significant projects for a given location. If developers are aware that there is a high likelihood of volatile weather throughout a given month range, then a developer may determine that it is best to start their project in a different month to prevent delays to their timeline.\n",

        "The overall goal of this model is to be used as an severe weather predictor by volume for states."

        "We will analyze the performance of this regression model through the mean squared error metric. This model will be considered a success if the prediction is within +/- 2 events for most states. Our data set includes disaster declarations for 2022. Our initial data set will become our validation set; we will create a test set that excludes events from 2022. Given the devastating financial impact of a single disaster, precision is paramount. "
